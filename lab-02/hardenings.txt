It's hard to avoid all the risks that are presented by the code because the code contains many bugs, so
the risks may be avoided by fixing this bugs primarily.

However, I tried to collect some advice that can help to mitigate the risks.

1. User Account Security:
    Create a user account with limited privileges specifically for running application:

    ```
    sudo adduser application
    sudo chown application:application hash
    su - application -c ./hash
    ```

2. Make sure your C files and any executables are not globally writable:
    ```
    chmod 755 hash
    chmod 644 hash.c hash.h
    ```

3. Use Access Control Lists:
    Utilize ACLs to fine-tune access permissions for users and groups on your files and directories.

    ```
    sudo setfacl -m u:applicatoin:rw hash
    ```

4. Enable Memory Protection Features:
    ```
    gcc -o hash hash.c -fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -O2 -Wformat -Wformat-security
    ```

    * `-fstack-protector-strong` option enables stack protection mechanisms to help prevent stack buffer overflow attacks.
    * `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` option enables additional compile-time and runtime checks for certain built-in functions to help mitigate the risks associated with buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Setting _FORTIFY_SOURCE to 2 activates more aggressive optimizations and checks.
    * `-O2` is an optimization level flag that tells the compiler to optimize the code.
    * `-Wformat -Wformat-security` are warning flags that enable warnings related to `printf`-style format specifiers in functions that are called with format strings.

5. Utilize Address Space Layout Randomization:
    ASLR is enabled by default in modern Linux systems, providing an additional layer of protection against buffer overflow attacks.

    ```
    cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    ```

    Ensure it returns `2` (full randomization).

6. Compile-time Hardening:
    Compile with warnings enabled to catch issues early:

    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o hash hash.c
    ```

7. Static Code Analysis:
    Integrate a static analysis tool into a development workflow.

    ```bash
    cppcheck hash.c hash.h
    ```

8. Use Isolated Environments:
    Consider using `Docker` to isolate the execution environment for your applications.
    This reduces the risk of your application affecting or being affected by the host OS.
